Google recently published both a very exciting paper and source code for a newly designed CNN (convolutional neural network) called EfficientNet, that set new records for both accuracy and computational efficiency.

## EfficientNet

EfficientNets are a family of image classification models, which achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, yet being an order-of-magnitude smaller and faster than previous models.

EfficientNets were developed based on AutoML and Compound Scaling. In particular, first use AutoML Mobile framework to develop a mobile-size baseline network, named as EfficientNet-B0; Then, use the compound scaling method to scale up this baseline to obtain EfficientNet-B1 to B7.
